      <p>After I watched Raya and the Last Dragon, this movie is just WOW!!!

        WARNING:
        This may have major spoilers, but I highly recommend you not to read it, if you already watched it, you will understand what I have meant about Raya and the Last Dragon.
        
        Everything inside Raya is just based on an Southeast Asian tradition and culture, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and more Southeast countries, and I felt like that Raya is unique.
        
        The story, or narrative is amazing, and astonishing, with Raya and her gang, such as Sisu, Boun, Noi, Tong, the Ongis, and Tuk Tuk, are trying to save the world and restore peace and reunite Kumandra. I love how the story works as well as how each of their families and their tribe has been turned to stone, or ash, correct me if I’m wrong. Everything in Raya is much more similar to Moana, but with more cultural narrative. As for that, Sisu is LOL! How she acted like is more like the Genie, or Mushu. Battle scenes in Raya are REALLY INTENSE, and I’m not lying, it’s really brutal and intense than Moana and Frozen (if they actually add blood and gore, that would be the only animated movie with PG-13, like Mulan (2020), but even more mature and intense) (Funny Fact: Raya and Namari is almost like Cloud and Sephiroth, but Raya and Namari are more like friends, while Cloud and Sephiroth are rivals, if you don’t know what I’m discussing about, Cloud and Sephiroth are from FFVII, and FFVII Remake, if you search it up)
        
        The cinematography, JUST AMAZING AND WOW!!! Every shot inside Raya is so much detailed and filled with charisma, great job Disney, for that, I give credit for that! :) And almost every shot is more like reality, and some of them are inspired by Star Wars, or other movies that I know, but don’t know the name. Many scenes in Raya are considered as beautiful shots in 2021 industry.
        
        The character development is outstanding and yes, MORE WOW!!!! How they developed the character is more like Moana, and almost like Frozen, but more with Southeast Asian looks. The voice cast did an excellent job of voicing the characters from Raya, including Kelly Maria Tran and Awkwakina, voicing both Raya and Sisu, WONDERFUL JOB, KELLY AND AWKWAFINA!
        
        The music, sound and scoring, JUST WOW!!!! How they did their music score of Raya is similar to both Frozen and Moana, but with more traditional instruments from their culture and tradition in countries of Southeast Asia. Some scenes with the music are sad, some are intense, and some of them are filled with happiness. “Lead the Way” by Jhene Aiko, was SUPER LIT AND JUST MORE WOW!!! I love the music of Aiko, including the harp and the beat drops by the lyrics of “Lead the Way”, if they have an orchestrated version of “Lead the Way”, like the close look trailer of Lead the Way”, I would be glad to hear it, with more drums and strings and brasses, and maybe woodwinds.
        
        Everything in Raya is amazing, remarkable, outstanding, and yes, EVEN MORE WOW!!!! Thanks Disney for this unique and special movie that is based on a princess warrior who is trying to restore peace, and save the world with trustworthy and mostly friendship and family!</p>

        <p>HOLY!  WOW!  WHAT AN ADVENTURE!  I loved how the story focused on bringing others together then blowing things up.  I loved how the story was set in Autumn.  Autumn is the season that most people aren’t interested in.  When people watch this movie people will realize that Autumn is festive if we just see it from a different perspective.  I also loved how the native people who lived in the forest rely upon and trust nature.  That is the way we are supposed to view nature.  This movie is connecting to the four great natural resources that we use on our planet - Air, Fire, Water, and Earth.  That is so environmentalist!  Without these resources, we wouldn't exist!  My favorite characters are Elsa and Anna.  I really loved Elsa and Anna's character because these girls are worthy of taking risks on their own just like men do.  Also, their mother had these two daughters for a very important reason.  Elsa performed by Idina Menzel is the perfect mythic and larger than life character.  Grateful her kingdom now accepts her, she works hard to be a good queen. But deep down she can’t help but wonder why she was born with powers.  When Elsa hears a voice that only she can hear it made me think it’s something important.  Like maybe something she has forgotten or maybe something she's supposed to know.  At the end of the movie, she realizes who she really is.  That's why the creators made her hair white.  Elsa was born with white hair and she couldn't change it.  She finds out what her hair means.  Something even more than having her power.  As for Anna, I really loved her character too.  Anna performed by Kristen Bell is the perfect fairytale character - unflappable, she is the forever optimist.  Anna is fine as long as she has her family, Arendelle is safe, and she never has to be alone again.  As Anna journeys with Elsa to the enchanted forests beyond Arendelle, along with Kristoff, Olaf and Sven, she wonders if they can ever return to the happiness they once knew.  I also enjoyed Kristoff's performance by Jonathan Groff.  Kristoff doesn’t hesitate to be there for Anna and Elsa as they journey into mysterious lands that even this well-traveled iceman has never seen.   I also was very amused by Olaf's performance by Josh Gad.   Having learned to read, he’s absolutely fascinated with the various wonders of life.  With his new curiosity for knowledge, Olaf is a source of hope in dark times.  Olaf also states a very deep sentiment in this movie and that is, "Water has memory."  That has a so deep meaning!  Olaf also learns in this movie that there are some conflicts in life.  And I also really enjoyed Sven's character.  Although Kristoff now has the love of his life with Anna, he still finds himself leaning on Sven as a best friend and a confidante and mentor, especially as Kristoff’s attempts to propose to Anna go awry.  Sven tries his best to help out his best friend and makes sure that he guides down the right path.   Also what I really loved about this movie is that all of the cast members who were in this movie sounded like angels!  When looking at the music score, my favorite song was, “Show Yourself."  The message is that if you follow your dreams, you will see who you are and you will become who you were born to be.  This movie is filled with generosity, integrity, optimism, cooperation, tolerance, and above all, spirituality.  Thank you so much Walt Disney Animated Studios for the astounding movie!  Please keep making more films that focus on heartfelt messages which bring people together by accepting differences and hearing stories that go unnoticed.</p>
